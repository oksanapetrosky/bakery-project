            <p>The story of the worldâ€™s most famous bakery begins in 2005 on a quaint,</p>
            <p>cobblestone corner in the West Village where Vintage Bakery opened its doors for the first time.</p>
            <p>The sweet smell of cakes and cookies and pies and pudding tumbled out,</p>
            <p>wafting down the streets, beckoning all in.</p>
            <p>Our red velvet cupcakes became iconic and people lined up around the block for our banana pudding.</p>
            <p>There was even talk of New York pretzel guys becoming cupcake guys.</p>
            <p>Vintage Bakery was a destination for locals and tourists alike.</p>
            <p>It was time for us to open the cupboards and share our magic with the world.</p>
            <p>Our neighborhood bakery found its way into new neighborhoods near and far, we wrote cookbooks and </p>
            <p>helped people all over celebrate their most important moments.</p>
            <p>And while we have grown, a few things will always remain: open early and close late,</p>
            <p>a dollop of buttercream makes everything better, and our mission: make today sweeter than yesterday. </p>
